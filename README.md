C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty byte code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line.

A stack in C is nothing but a linear data structure that follows the LIFO rule (Last In First Out). In a stack, both insertion and deletion take place from just one end, that is, from the top.

In a stack, the operation of inserting an element into the stack is referred to as pushing an element in the stack. The elements are inserted into the stack from the top and hence would compel the elements to shift.


The queue follows the FIFO rule(first in first out)
